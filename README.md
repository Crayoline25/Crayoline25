 About me

Unicorn

I am a Computer Science student, currently halfway through my degree, I am expanding my knowledge in both back-end and front-end development. I have experience as a web developer for the restaurant industry, and my goal is to strengthen my development skills and explore new technologies. I love to learn and build something new, creative and funny.
